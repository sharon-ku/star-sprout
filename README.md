# Star Sprout
 Project by Leanne Suen Fa & Sharon Ku
 
Star Sprout Village is a world filled with tiny greenhouses hanging magically, like a constellation of tiny individual bubbles. The users can navigate through this space and visit each other. 

The user cultivates precious plants in someone elseâ€™s garden by sending them loving messages. It is only through continuous collaboration and communication that the garden will be healthy and bloom. We want to empower users to feel good about themselves when they view their progress and give a visual representation of their mutual efforts to develop a relationship with someone else.

## Stage 1: Proposal

We proposed our idea for Greenhouse Hub (later called Star Sprout):

## Stage 2: Prototype

Midway through the project, we created a prototype that presented the basic user interface:

## Stage 3: Final

We finished developing Star Sprout and implemented the messaging function! Although we can't upload the live project because we're using Node.js, here's a video of a walkthrough:
